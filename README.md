# Contributing to Trilogy Recipes

Purpose
This cookbook contains recipes that demonstrate how to solve common problems seen in student projects. Each recipe is self-contained and can be used as a reference to help the instructional staff be debug-ready during projects.

## Our Development Process

We use Kanban to store our pipeline of recipes and to keep track of who is working on what in effort to avoid repeats. Feel free to submit ideas to our pipeline of recipes.

## Pull Requests

Please make sure the following is done when submitting a pull request:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Include comments highlighting integral parts of the recipe.
7. Well Documented README

## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

## Coding Style

We use Prettier to format our JavaScript code. This saves you time and energy as you can let Prettier fix up any formatting issues automatically through its editor integrations, or by manually running `npm run prettier`. We also use a linter to catch styling issues that may exist in your code. You can check the status of your code styling by simply running `npm run lint`.
