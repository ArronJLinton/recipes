  ###### Identify the target audience.
  ###### Identify the problem that the product will address.
  ###### Write down the primary goal of the product.
  ###### Identify and prioritize essential user stories.

#### Idea: I'll build an online code editor with Stack Overflow integration."

#### Target Audience: My target audience is developers who need help from Stack Overflow."

#### Problem: Our problem is that developers need help from Stack Overflow but lose time switching between the editor and browser windows."

#### Goal: Our goal is to provide a seamless way to search for helpful code snippets while coding."

### User Stories:

  1. As a user, I want to be able to type code into an editor so that I can build small features in a sandbox environment.
  2. As a user, I want to be able to input search queries so that I can search Stack Overflow when I'm stuck.
  3. As a user, I want to be able to see relevant Stack Overflow results, so that I can incorporate them into my code. 

- Nice-To-Haves

Purpose
This cookbook contains recipes that demonstrate how to solve common problems seen in student projects. Each recipe is self-contained and can be used as a reference to help the instructional staff be debug-ready during projects.

## Pull Requests

Please make sure the following is done when submitting a pull request:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Include comments highlighting integral parts of the recipe.
6. Well Documented README

## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track projects, public bugs, etc. Please ensure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

## Coding Style

We use Prettier to format our JavaScript code. This saves you time and energy as you can let Prettier fix up any formatting issues automatically through its editor integrations, or by manually running `npm run prettier`. We also use a linter to catch styling issues that may exist in your code. You can check the status of your code styling by simply running `npm run lint`. To automatically fix some of the problems reported by eslint, run `npm run fix`.
